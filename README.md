# About

Taking the APIs from PokeAPI:
- https://pokeapi.co/

We would like you to come up with a fresh clean UI design of displaying the
individual pokemon and being able to flick through them but also being able to view
them as a searchable list. We would like to see the ability to click into the pokemon
and view their abilities.

## What to use??
Next.js and TailwindCSS + Typescript

## What features is this for??
We are looking for the ability to view the Pokemon as a list, and also show the ability
of lazy loading the pokemon. It should have the ability to click the individual
Pokemon to show their abilities and stats. We would like to see a search where we
can filter out the pokemon list to find a Pokemon.
